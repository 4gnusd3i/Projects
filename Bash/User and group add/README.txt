# User and group add
This script was made for a specific purpose and solved a task where I needed to
automate adding new users from a file, to a new group that I could specify the
name and ID of. Beeing able to specify what shell the users should have as
default, was also part of the requirements.

In short:
The script takes 4 arguments in order to create a usergroup with a specified
groupid, before creating new users from a textfile and assigning them a
specified shell and default password.
