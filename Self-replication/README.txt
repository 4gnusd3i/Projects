# Self-replication
This script is a demonstration on self-replication. The script will write its own contents to a new file and attach a random string to generate a new hash. The script also includes the functionality needed to make the new files perfom the same operation and in theory behave like a forkbomb. This functionality is by default turned off to not cause any uintended damage.
